# The Royal Game Of Ur

An two-player implementation of the Royal Game of Ur board game, the oldest playable board game.

# About

The Royal Game of Ur, also known as the Game of Twenty Squares, is an ancient board game, found in the Royal Tombs of Ur in Iraq by Sir Leonard Woolley in the 1920s. The two found boards date from the First Dynasty of Ur, before 2600 BC, thus making the Royal Game of Ur one of the oldest examples of board gaming equipment found. The Ur-style Twenty Squares gameboard was also known in Egypt as Asseb, and has been found in Pharaoh Tutankhamen's tomb, among other places. Discovery of a tablet partially describing the gameplay has allowed the game to be played again after over 2000 years.

# Starting up

The game currently requires the free asset "TextMesh Pro", available on the Unity Asset Store. This asset is however not included with this repositroy as I'm unsure of its license. 

## First time startup:
- Please do not open the project file before doing these steps.
- Create an empty Unity Project
- Import the "TextMesh Pro" asset from the asset store (Window/Asset Store -> Search "TextMesh Pro" -> Open asset by Unity Technologies -> Import -> Import All)
- This will create a folder in your assets called "TextMesh Pro". Copy this folder and paste it into the cloned repository, directly into the assets folder.
- Open the project in Unity
